# About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Mike DeBoda, a passionate IT manager with a deep love for technology, continuous self-improvement, and all things related to AI and the digital world. I'm currently based in Oxford, PA, and I'm on a mission to become the best version of my former self each day.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Background

- 🏢 I work as the sole IT manager at Shorehaven Inc., where I'm responsible for all things technology. My work primarily involves managing and optimizing IT systems for a special needs school, and I typically do this remotely.
- 🎓 I have a solid educational background with an associate degree in general studies from Cecil College (2015) and another associate degree in Intelligence Studies from Cochise College (2021). I've also earned certifications like CompTIA Network+, Security+, Pen Test+, and the Google IT Support Certificate from Coursera.
- 💼 Early in my career, I worked as a help desk tech at Cecil College and served as an intelligence analyst for the Army National Guard from 2010 to 2015. I've also worked with Data Networks as a desktop deployment technician.
- 🚀 My career goals include achieving financial independence by 2024, obtaining a CompTIA CySA+ certification by 2025, and continuously improving my professional skills.

## 🌟 Hobbies and Interests

Outside of my professional life, I've got diverse interests:

- 🎥 I'm a fan of Marvel movies and shows, and I enjoy keeping up with the latest in pop culture.
- 💪 I'm into resistance/strength training, which is part of my personal development journey.
- 📚 Reading is a passion of mine, and I aim to read at least 30 minutes daily to expand my knowledge.
- 🏡 I'm actively working on creating a modern basement patio with a firepit, exploring home lab setups, and diving into home automation.
- 🧘 Meditation helps me stay focused and maintain a balanced life.
- 🥋 I have an interest in martial arts and self-improvement, drawing inspiration from great minds like Dale Carnegie, Jim Rohn, Jordan Peterson, and even fictional characters like Tony Stark.

Feel free to connect with me and join me on my journey of self-improvement and exploration of the digital world! 🚀
