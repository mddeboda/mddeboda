# About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Mike DeBoda, an IT Security enthusiast interested in tech, self-improvement, and philosophy.

## 🧑‍💻 Background

- 🏢 I work as the sole IT manager at a private school where I'm responsible for all information technology. My work primarily involves managing and optimizing IT systems, and I typically do this remotely.
- 🎓 I have an associate degree in general studies from Cecil College (2015) and  associate degree in Intelligence Studies from Cochise College (2021). I hold CompTIA Network+, Security+, Pen Test+, and the Google IT Support Certificate from Coursera.

- 🎥 I'm a fan of Marvel movies and shows.
- 💪 I'm into resistance/strength training.
- 📚 Reading is a passion, and I aim to read at least 30 minutes daily to expand my knowledge.
- 🧘 Meditation helps me stay focused and present.
- 🥋 I am interested in martial arts and self-improvement, I am inspired by Dale Carnegie, Jim Rohn, Jordan Peterson, and fictional characters like Tony Stark.
