# About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Mike DeBoda, an IT manager interested in technology, continuous self-improvement, and all things  AI and the digital world. I'm currently based in Oxford, PA, and I'm on a mission to become the best version of my former self each day.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Background

- 🏢 I work as the sole IT manager at a private school where I'm responsible for all information technology. My work primarily involves managing and optimizing IT systems, and I typically do this remotely.
- 🎓 I have an associate degree in general studies from Cecil College (2015) and another associate degree in Intelligence Studies from Cochise College (2021). I hold CompTIA Network+, Security+, Pen Test+, and the Google IT Support Certificate from Coursera.


## 🌟 Hobbies and Interests

Outside of my professional life, I've got diverse interests:

- 🎥 I'm a fan of Marvel movies and shows.
- 💪 I'm into resistance/strength training.
- 📚 Reading is a passion, and I aim to read at least 30 minutes daily to expand my knowledge.
## - 🏡 I'm actively trying to save up to create a modern basement/patio with a firepit, exploring home lab setups, and diving into home automation.
- 🧘 Meditation helps me stay focused and present.
- 🥋 I am interested in martial arts and self-improvement, I am inspired by Dale Carnegie, Jim Rohn, Jordan Peterson, and fictional characters like Tony Stark.
